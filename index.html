         <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Growing up one thing that my family did was travel. Now although we could not afford to fly, that did not stop my parents from making sure we still got to see a lot of the U.S.A. and Canada.
             Now that I am older I am <strong>greatful</strong> for hard work my parents did to make sure we were able to travel. 
            I have 2 boys now and although we have traveled I want to be take them some of the places I have wanted to go to since I was a teenager.</p>

         <h2 class="subhead">Hawaii</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph">Hawaii has been on my bucket list ever since my aunt went on a cruise and the cruise we to the main islands on Hawaii. 
            I asked my dad for years "let's go to Hawaii for our next family vacation", and every year he would say 
            "baby your husband is gone have to take you to Hawaii." I'm not married yet so that's probably why it is still on my list. 
         Married or not my boys and I will get to Hawaii!!!

         <h2 class="subhead">Paris, France</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph">A.K.A. City of Love!!! I think Paris is beautiful. One of my bestfriend went to Paris when I was pregnant with my first son. 
            I should have been with her :(, but baby comes first. I may not have been able to make that trip but one of these days
            me and my boys are going to go and visit <a href="https://www.disneylandparis.com/en-usd/" target="_blank">Disney Land</a>, Paris!!!
         After then the Eiffel Tower of course. IT was built in 1889 and still is one of the top tourist sites. I would love to see this one day soon.

         <h2 class="subhead">Rome, Italy</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph">Rome is full of history, culture, and good food. When you see pictures of things like the 
            Colosseum, the Pantheon, The central Trevi Fountain, and the Sistine Chapel how can you not want to see those beautiful structures in person. I can only 
            imagine how good my pasta dinner would taste. I would love for my to see that kind of history and see what other parts of the world has to offer.

         <h2 class="subhead">China</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph">Although I always though China was beautiful, I never really had a desire to go. My oldest son
            however is obsessed with geography and he talks about China and all this Asia. I know it would be a dream of his to go to China one day. 
            I hope that one day we can visit and see everything he wants to see as long as one is The Great Wall of China.

         <h2 class="subhead">Capetown</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph">South Africa!!!! This would truly be a dream come true. Capetown is the oldest city in S. Africa and has so much history, and
            amazing views. I would also love to see the prison that once held former <a href="https://www.nelsonmandela.org/content/page/biography" target="_blank" >President Nelson Mandela</a> learn more about him and all he has done for South Africa. This is a 
            trip I would have to wait to take until my boys are about 10 years older because I want to to appreciate the land they are walking on and remember.
